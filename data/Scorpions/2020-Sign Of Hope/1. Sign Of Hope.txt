Sometimes it's easy to pretend
The world keeps turning 'round and 'round
And why's it going out of hand
I fear my life turns upside down
Give me hope, just a little bit of hope
A little comfort for my soul
And it's gonna be alright
Give me hope just a little bit of hope
I know you're gonna take me home
And love we're tryin' to light
In troubled times we need a friend
We keep on waiting for better times
Help me God, here I am
Alone with all my fears tonight
Give me hope, just a little bit of hope
A little comfort for my soul
And it's gonna be alright
Give me hope just a little bit of hope
I know you're gonna take me home
And love we're tryin' to light
What has happened to our life
I see empty places empty roads
We say a prayer ever night
Just waiting for a sign of hope
Give me hope, just a little bit of hope
A little comfort for my soul
And it's gonna be alright
