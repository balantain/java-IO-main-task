[Verse 1]
I realize I missed a day
But I'm too wrecked to care anyway
I look around and see this face
What the hell have I lost my taste

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't want to find out
Just want to cut out

[Verse 2]
My head explodes my ears ring
I can't remember just where I've been
The last thing that I recall
I got lost in a deep black hole

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't want to find out
Just want to cut out

[Chorus]
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
[Verse 3]
I grab my things and make a run
On my way out, another one
Would like to know before I stop
Did I make it or did I flop

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't want to find out
Just want to get out, yeah!

[Chorus]
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
I really had a blackout, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't want to find out
Just want to get out
[Chorus]
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout

[Post-Chorus]
Blackout
Blackout
Blackout

Oh, yeah....!
